# Getting Started

Clams is a [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) interface for managing your Bitcoin finances. The app's primary goal is to address the accounting challenge by syncing all wallet data into a single, secure, and localized hub. This enables seamless management, tracking, and reporting of transactions. Ultimately, our aim is to create a tool that empowers individuals and businesses to easily operate within a Bitcoin standard.

It is available as a [desktop application](https://github.com/clams-tech) or as a [browser app](https://app.clams.tech) (PWA). The first wallet connection that is supported is [Core Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning).

## Prerequisites

1. A Core Lightning node running version `0.12.0` or later.
2. Command line access to generate a Rune authentication token.
