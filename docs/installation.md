## PWA

Clams is offered as a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing you to install it directly on your device. Once installed, it provides a user experience similar to that of a native app downloaded from an app store. The PWA is particularly useful for anyone that requires access to their nodes via their cellphone, especially while on the go.
