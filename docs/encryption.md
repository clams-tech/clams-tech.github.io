# Encryption

When the you first open the app you will be prompted to encrypt all of the local Clams data stored on your device with a secure password. This means that your data at rest is always encrypted and will be loaded in to memory and decrypted when you enter your password. It is important that you choose a secure password, especially if you are going to grant the app permission to spend.

Every time you reload the app you will be prompyed for this password. If you forget your password, you will have to reset the app which will delete all of the local data and Wallet connections. So make sure to store a backup of your secure password in a secure place - either in a password manager or offline.
